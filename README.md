Some assets to use in your livestream made in HTML + Javascript + CSS

Open HTML directory to see a list of features available:
## Brawl Stars
### Banned List
It is useful when you are streaming a Brawl Stars Tournament and you want to show banned brawlers (up to 2 brawlers) by each team.
#### How to use
Put teams logo in Brawl Stars/bannedList/teams directory (png files with transparency are preferable).
Open **bannedList.html** file with your text editor of your choice and edit JSON ``const teams`` with desired teams where "name" are team names and "image" are files pasted in teams directory;
Open **bannedList.html** with an internet browser and choose teams and banned brawlers.
After everything set, pay attention to generated URL and interface.
Open your streaming software (like OBS Studio), add a Browser source, copy generated URL and paste it to source.
You should see it on the preview screen:

## Clash Royale
### Neon Border
It's a neon border that you can use as a vertical screen border. This border blings with the same Clash Royale cards color rarity pattern: blue, orange, purple, white and yellow.
Just add it to your streaming sofware as a Browser source. and put your screen behind it. To make your screen with radius border, will depend on which streaming software you are using. For OBS Studio, I recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qPeNivUhoA).

## Stopwatch
A stopwatch for your livestreaming. It uses a stopwatch with Super Mario World's font-family, but you can use any font of your choice.
Super Mario World's font-family can be found on the internet as **SuperMario256.ttf** then you can download and install it on your computer.
It plays a song and on last 10 seconds, it plays another song. On the end, it plays a sound as time over.
Just add **stopwatch.html** file to your streaming sofware as a Browser source.
